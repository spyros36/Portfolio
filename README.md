The first project is an AR game that was developed during my academic years and it is called Zombies and Mines.
Mehcanics: 
          The player has to click on the Red button to instantiate an obstacle called chest in order to place it 
          wherever the mines are on the ground. Every time the player eliminates a mine he gets some points. If the player
          misses a mine and the zombie walks over the mine then the zombie dies and it's a Game Over!
          
The second project it was an "Advanced Graphics" assignemnt and we had to create an immersive environment that makes the player explore the place.
